- Trace.v defines traces and bisimilarity. It proves bisimilarity is
reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

- Language.v defines the While language.

- BigRel.v defines the big-step relational semantics and proves that it is
deterministic and a setoid predicate.

- SmallRel.v defines the small-step relational semantics and proves
that it is deterministic and a setoid predicate and that the big-step
relational and small-step relational semantics are equivalent.

- BigFunct.v defines the big-step functional semantics and proves that
the big-step relational and the big-step functional semantics are
equivalent.

- SmallFunct.v defines the small-step functional semantics and proves
that the small-step relational and the small-step functional semantics
are equivalent and that the small-step functional and the big-step
functional semantics are equivalent. 

- Alternatives.v gives the complete formalizations of the alternative
big-step semantics considered in the accompanying paper.
